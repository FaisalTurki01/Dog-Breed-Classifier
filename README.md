# Dog Breed Classifier

This project is part of the AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program from Udacity. It is designed to showcase your skills in using Python for data analysis, deep learning, and computer vision.

## Description

The project involves building a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images of dogs according to their breed. The dataset used in this project is the [Dog Breed Identification dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data) from Kaggle. The goal is to achieve a high accuracy in predicting the breed of a dog given an input image.

## Required Libraries and Dependencies

The project requires the following libraries:

- PyTorch
- torchvision
- NumPy
- Matplotlib


## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Dog Breed Identification dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data) from Kaggle. The dataset includes 10,000+ labeled images of 120 different dog breeds. You will need to download and extract the dataset files to a directory on your local machine.
